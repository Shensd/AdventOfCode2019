The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is a yearly challenge that asks its players to complete a code challenge every single day from December first up until Christmas. 

Here is a list of challenges I have completed with what language used:

| Day | Challenge | Language | Stars |
| --- | --------- | -------- | ----- | 
| 1   | [The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1) | Python | ** |
| 2   | [1202 Program Alarm](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) | C++ | ** |
| 3   | [Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) | C++ | * |
| 4   | [Secure Container](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4) | Python | ** |
| 5   | [Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) | C++ | ** |
| 6   | [Universal Orbit Map](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6) | TypeScript | ** |

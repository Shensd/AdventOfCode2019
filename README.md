# Advent of Code 2019 

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is a yearly challenge that asks its players to complete a code challenge every single day from December first up until Christmas. 

Here is a list of challenges I have completed with what language used:

| Day | Challenge | Language | 
| --- | --------- | -------- |
| 1   | [The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1) | Python |

I am hoping by making this public that it will push me more to keep on top of getting the challenges done every day.
